## Welcome to the website of Vulcain Trading

### Who are we?

Vulcain Trading was founded by Ivy CHANG, sourcing manager of a large multinational company. She has over 12 years of experience in purchasing, importing and exporting, and more generally in setting up and adapting Western companies in China.

Vulcain Trading works in French, English or Chinese.

Our wish is to set up a long-term partnership with you to ensure your representation in China, as much for the selection and management of suppliers as for missions organization and the interface with the different Chinese authorities.
